L10: 25 TON
L8: 12 TON
L5: 6 TON

25-40 TON seems to be the baseline for a 1Bn NUGS account.

To hide the behaviour, ideally I'm only creating as many accts as ~20% of the actual spend.

So if I want to create 5k accts, we'd need 25k spending 40 ton, which is waaaaay more than we'll take in.

10k accts each pulling 500M-750M? $6M pull.
