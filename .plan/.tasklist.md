# User Data

[x] build data file
[x] make the seed trees use all 80-100 david references, not just 20%

# Email Addresses

[x] either find an old email addy file, or just make them up.

# Cron jobs

[ ] create a cron job that calls a cron function (that can do things every ~5 min)
[ ] cron a (slow) user creation via api
[ ] cron users making (many) slots calls, and (few) other calls
[ ] cron a (slower) user update to full tokens etc via direct mongodb

# User Creation

[x] Create and test telegramInitData
[x] Seed users into supabase via csv
[ ] Create and short run temp users (no wallet/email)

# User data setup

[ ] function that will call some Ore > NUGS for users
[ ] call google analytics for users, as people are watching things like wallet connections.
[ ] consider spending some real $ to make the influx more believable

# Google Analytics

[x] set and test push fake GA data
[ ] check that MP data is stored in the actual data
[ ] wire up to actual cron jobs

# Wallet Tree Creation

[ ] One seed phrase
[ ] Enable up to 9 branches from each node: CBAxx > C level are the ones that we use; others are buffers.

# Manual Wallet Seeding

[ ] Create ~15 email addresses
[ ] Build VPN process
[ ] Move funds into buffer exchange & swap to TON
[ ] Move funds from buffer exchange to filter exchanges
[ ] For each created exchange account, track email, password, VPN location, deposit addy (ETH), deposit addy (TON)

# Automatic Wallet Seeding

[ ] Write the seeding function
[ ] - seed down the "I referred you" chain, and back up to the top ~80

# Airdrop Collection

[ ] we don't know how this will work; we should expect it to cost up to 1 ton.
